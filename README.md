    class Auth,Encrypt security
    class PC,HL,Zoom core
    class HL7,DB data
```

The diagram illustrates the key architectural components, where:

- Red components represent security measures protecting all interactions
- Green components show core systems handling clinical workflows
- Blue components indicate data exchange and storage layers
- Bidirectional arrows demonstrate real-time data synchronization between systems

Data Layers:

- EPIC Integration: HL7 FHIR APIs for bidirectional data flow with Epic MyChart
- Cloud Infrastructure: Azure-hosted Cerner Command Center for real-time monitoring

Modules:

- PowerChart: EHR core with embedded telehealth documentation
- HealtheLife: Patient portal with OAuth 2.0 authentication

### 2.2 Competitive Benchmarking: Cerner vs Epic

| Feature | Cerner Millennium | Epic Systems |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telehealth Customization | Full SDK access for third-party integrations | Limited to Epic-approved partners |
| Analytics | Predictive risk modeling (e.g., sepsis alerts) | Retrospective reporting tools |
| Patient Portal UX | Mobile-first design with AI chatbots | Desktop-optimized interface |
| Pricing Model | Subscription + % of revenue | Fixed annual licensing |

## 3. Business Analysis Documentation Framework

### 3.1 Sample Business Requirements Document (BRD)

Cerner Telehealth Example

| Section | Objective | Functional Req. 1 | Non-Functional Req. 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cerner Telehealth | Reduce no-show rates by 25% in 6 months | Integrate automated SMS reminders via Twilio | 9.99% uptime during peak hours (8 AMâ€“6 PM) |

### 3.2 Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

| Requirement ID | Test Case | Status | Stakeholder Sign-Off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CERN-TH-001 | Telehealth session encryption | Passed | Dr. Smith (CMO) |

### 3.3 User Story Template

As a primary care physician,

I want real-time access to patient vitals during telehealth visits,

So that I can adjust treatment plans without delaying care.

## 4. System Analysis & SDLC Alignment

### 4.1 Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Techniques:

- Joint Application Design (JAD) Sessions: 10 workshops with ER physicians to map triage workflows
- MoSCoW Prioritization: Classified 50+ requirements into Must-have/Could-have buckets

### 4.2 SDLC Hybrid Model (Agile-Waterfall)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Preparation["Preparation Phase"]
        P1["Education & Training"] 
        P2["Backup Systems"]
        P3["Downtime Kits"]
        P4["Drills & Communication"]
    end

    subgraph Response["Response Phase"]
        R1["System Activation"]
        R2["Medication Management"]
        R3["Patient Tracking"]
        R4["Imaging Webpage"]
    end

    subgraph Recovery["Recovery Phase"]
        C1["Uptime Medication"]
        C2["Clinical Documentation"]
        C3["EHR Notes"]
    end

    Preparation --> Response
    Response --> Recovery

    classDef prep fill:#ff9999,stroke:#ff0000,color:#000000
    classDef resp fill:#99ff99,stroke:#00ff00,color:#000000
    classDef recov fill:#9999ff,stroke:#0000ff,color:#000000
    
    class P1,P2,P3,P4 prep
    class R1,R2,R3,R4 resp
    class C1,C2,C3 recov
```

The workflow diagram illustrates the three critical phases of implementation, where:

- Red components represent preparation activities ensuring readiness
- Green components show response procedures during transition
- Blue components indicate recovery strategies for stabilization

Sprint 1 (Waterfall):

- Completed infrastructure readiness assessment for Cerner cloud migration

Sprint 2 (Agile):

- Delivered patient portal MVP with 2FA in 4 weeks
